# Introducing PromptAppGPT: A rapid prompt app development framework based on GPT 

Hi all! We're rolling out **a rapid prompt app development framework - PromptAppGPT.** 

PromptAppGPT is a low-code prompt-based rapid app development framework. PromptAppGPT contains features such as low-code prompt-based development, GPT text generation, DALLE image generation, online prompt editer+compiler+runer, automatic user interface generation, support for plug-in extensions, etc. PromptAppGPT aims to enable natural language app development based on GPT.

**PromptAppGPT significantly lowers the barrier to GPT application development, allowing anyone to implement their own AutoGPT-like application with 70 lines of low code.**
